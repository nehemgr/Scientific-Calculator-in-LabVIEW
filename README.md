# Scientific-Calculator-in-LabVIEW
In this project, a scientfic calculator has been implemented in LabVIEW using Event Structures. The calculator can handle entire numeric or trignometric expressions and also offers a delete option to clear off the previously pressed character on the screen, as well a memory ANS button which holds the current output answer to re-use it in further calculations. Any incoherent inputs are flagged as syntax errors.
